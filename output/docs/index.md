# Parcel Management System - Documentation

## Overview
The Parcel Management System is a Java-based web application designed to manage parcel bookings, deliveries, and tracking. The system allows users to book parcels, track their status, and receive updates on delivery. It also provides an interface for officers to manage parcel deliveries and track parcels.

## Project Statistics
- **Total Files**: 61
- **Programming Languages**: Java, JSP, Markdown, XML
- **Last Updated**: [Current Date]

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Java
- **Frontend**: JSP
- **Database**: Not explicitly mentioned, but likely MySQL or similar relational database management system
- **Server**: Not explicitly mentioned, but likely Apache Tomcat or similar Java-based web server

## Architecture Overview
The system follows a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture pattern. The model layer consists of Java classes representing parcel, user, and payment data. The view layer consists of JSP files for rendering web pages. The controller layer consists of Java servlets that handle HTTP requests and interact with the model layer.
